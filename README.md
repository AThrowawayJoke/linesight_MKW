## Linesight

Linesight is a reinforcement learning project seeking to push what can be done with AI in Trackmania as far as possible. This fork translates the code to interface with Mario Kart Wii using the Dolphin emulator to do the same.

## Mario Kart Wii

The Mario Kart series has been a staple of every new Nintendo console for over two decades. Mario Kart Wii specifically, originally released in 2008, still has one of the strongest communities behind it with over [1000 Custom Tracks](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/List_of_Custom_Tracks) created for the game and [Custom Track Distributions](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Custom_Track_Distribution), which have allowed players to play online with several custom-coded features and gamemodes. Additionally, new strategies are being found and WRs are still being set every month on the original 32 tracks.

## Trackmania

Trackmania is a racing game that sacrifices some of the realism of sim-racers for a wide variety of track types with all kinds of tricks like wall riding, stunt jumps and wallbangs. Furthermore, Trackmania was designed for equality of input devices which means that keyboard inputs are a viable way to play and therefore that discrete input algorithms like DQN can be applied. In other words, Trackmania is a deep game which can serve as a benchmark to work on any RL algorithm.

## Results in Trackmania

To our knowledge, Linesight is by far the most advanced AI in Trackmania. It was the first to demonstrate human-level driving around May 2023, with [Wirtual playing against it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjHW3ai47Og) in June. In May 2024, Linesight was the first to [showcase beating world records on official campaign tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUojVsCJ51I).

Now that the project is open-source, can you help make it even stronger?
